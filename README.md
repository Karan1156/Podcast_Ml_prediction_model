#Overview
This project aims to develop an effective predictive model for podcasts using data such as episode details, audio features, metadata, and user engagement metrics. The main goal is to assist content creators, marketers, and listeners in understanding podcast trends and making data-driven decisions.

#Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Training various machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
Prediction on new podcast data
#Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes:

Podcast metadata (title, description, genre, etc.)
Audio features extracted from the podcast episodes
Engagement metrics like listens, shares, ratings, etc.
(Note: Replace with actual dataset description or link if available)

#Model Architecture
The core model is based on:

Data preprocessing steps (scaling, encoding)
Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
(Include-specific details about the model architecture if available)

#Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/Karan1156/Podcast_Ml_prediction_model.git
Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
#Usage
Prepare your dataset following the format described.
Run the notebook or script to preprocess data and train the model:
bash
jupyter notebook new.ipynb
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
#Results
The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the validation/test set, indicating good predictive performance. (Replace with actual results)
